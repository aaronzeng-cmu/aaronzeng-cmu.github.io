I am a current MIT PhD student pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am working under the mentorship of Dr. Laura Lewis, and my current project involves designing auditory stimulation algorithms to promote cerebrospinal fluid circulation during sleep to enhance waste clearance in humans.  I have a MS degree of Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, and BS degree of Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California San Diego and multiple years of research assistant experience working in computational neuroscience, medical device and machine learning projects. I strive to research cognitive basis of the brain with computational modeling and create a functional neuromodulation system with engineering toolsets.
